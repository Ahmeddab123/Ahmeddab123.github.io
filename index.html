    <h3> Professional Experience
 </div>
     <h4>Securitas</h4>
     <h5>Security Officer</h5>
     <h6>February 2022 - Current</h6>
    <ul>
      <li> My task is to patrol and gaurd a corporate building.</li>
      <li>At the start of the my shift I would look at my email to see if they're any new post orders. Then I would take the patrol car and check on the other building to check on the AED and the cooler room for the IT closet. </li>
      <li>My next task is to patrol all the floors in the main building. While patrolling I will check on the server room and the IT closets. I usually compelete these patrols in an hour or so. After I'm done with my patrols I would fill in one of the other security guards breaks.   </li>
      <li>While covering the other security guards break I will usually help give directions to visitors of the building.</li>

     <h4>RBC</h4>
     <h5>IT Desktop Support</h5>
     <h6>March 2022 - April 2022</h6>
    <ul>
      <li> My task was to walk around the floor that we were stationed on and see if anyone had problems with their computers. Issues that we looked for were if any of the computer monitors were flickering or wasn't working at all
      </li>
      <li>We would also check on the desktops to see if they were working. We would use a lot of trouble shooting to get the desktop to work, mainly by replacing wires, switching the main monitor to the second monitor, and replacing monitors or desktops if everything else hasn't worked.</li>
      
      <li>Another task that me and my coworkers were given was to take out all the old computers and wires that were left in the old RBC building. We managed to take care of it rather quickily and got one of the floors done in about four hours.</li>
